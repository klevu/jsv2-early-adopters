For the official Klevu JavaScript Library documentation, please visit [https://developers.klevu.com/javascript-library](https://developers.klevu.com/javascript-library). You can still browse the following getting started guides, but **we recommend using [Klevu Theme](https://developers.klevu.com/javascript-library/integration/klevu-theme) for your next integration**.

- **[Get started with Shopify](/getting-started/1-hello-world/shopify)**
- **[Get started with BigCommerce](/getting-started/1-hello-world/bigcommerce)**
- **[Get started with Magento 2](/getting-started/1-hello-world/magento2)**
- **[Get started with any other framework](/getting-started/1-hello-world/custom)**

Once you've completed the above,
[try some other common customizations here](/modules).

If you want to see an example of a number of these modules working together
in a single example, click here to [try a full Layout](/layout/layout-001).
