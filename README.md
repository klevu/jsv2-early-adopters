_This is a **beta** version of Klevu JS Library and we expect some changes to occur,
which will also be based on feedback from early adopters like yourselves,
so please bear this in mind during testing._

## Changelog

**5th November 2019**

Updated hello-world tutorials to include analytics, which is a vital part
of Klevu integration due to its role in the machine learning from customer interactions.

**30th September 2019**

Updated tutorial structure to separate out 'getting-started' for each framework,
components and modules for a more guided on-boarding process.

**13th September 2019**

Added tutorial for [getting started with any other framework](/getting-started/1-hello-world/custom),
using static HTML, JS and CSS to integrate Klevu JS Library with just a few lines of code.

**12th September 2019**

Re-structured to have 4x tutorials specific to each framework to
[get started](/getting-started),
then the remainder of the tutorials are platform agnostic.

Plus additional [more tutorials](/modules).

**6th September 2019**

Added various [new tutorials](/modules) and a Hello World guide
for both BigCommerce and Magento 2.

**24th June 2019**

Added a short introduction to take you from _nothing_ to a Shopify store using
Klevu Search with our new JavaScript Library Version 2, in around 10-15 minutes.
We will then introduce some further examples to help you understand more about
the power of Klevu JS Library.
