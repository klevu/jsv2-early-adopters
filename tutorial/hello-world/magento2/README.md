# Hello World Tutorial for Magento 2

The current Klevu Magento extension currently automatically integrates JSv1,
so for the time being this tutorial will not include a full data integration with Klevu
and will instead be used to showcase the templating and frontend functionality only.

## Integrate Klevu JSv2 with Magento 2

First create a new vanilla Magento store with your own preferred approach.

In the resources folder we have included an example extension for getting up and running
with Magento 2. Note at currently this example is very basic has settings such as the API key
hard-coded into the JS files, so feel free to use your own preferred approach to move files
around and make the necessary data configurable via Store Configuration, etc.

Add this extension to your demo store, and once you have enabled the extension,
**try searching for "bag"**.

This is just one simple way to integrate for illustrative purposes.
JSv2 is as flexible as Magento 2 so once you have completed this tutorial
you may find your own preferred file structure, layout implementation, etc.

## Make some Changes!

Now you have Klevu functionality entirely hosted on your own infrastructure
and are ready to make some more changes to customise your search results!
